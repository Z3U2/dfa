# dfa

School homework, simulating DFAs (Deterministic Finite Automata) and NFAs (Non Deterministic Finite Automata) using C.

DFA is simulated using multi dimensional arrays and linked lists (memory vs processing power).
NFA is simulated using linked lists. (to avoid memory consuming sparse multi dimensional arrays)
